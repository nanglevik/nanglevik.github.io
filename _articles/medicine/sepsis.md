# Summary

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, caused by an exaggerated immunological response to bacteriemia, driven by a storm of cytokines, NO-production, the complement system, and the coagulation cascade, leading to capillary leakage, systemic vasodilation and (septic) shock, leading to serve outcomes including DIC, multi organ failure (myocardial depression, bleeding, liver failure, kidney failure, and cerebral symptoms).

Starting early treatment is more important than finding a definite cause. In general, (possible) septic patients should be started with treatment within one hour.

qSOFA:

* RF ≥ 22  
* Systolic BP: ≤ 100 mmHg  
* Altered mental status

SIRS:

* Temperature \> 38 or \< 36  
* Pulse \> 90 (not reliable if on beta blockers)  
* RF \> 20, or with PaCO2 \< 4,3 kPa  
* WBC \> 12 or \< 4 

**One should suspect sepsis with qSOFA ≥ 2 or SIRS ≥ 5\.**

Treatment and diagnostic work-up includes getting blood samples, ABG, urine samples with addition of streptococcal urine antigen, pharyngeal swab (PCR), starting broad spectrum antibiotics (after cultures), fluid treatment, and getting a chest x-ray.
